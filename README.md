# RageMP-EclipseRP-Auto-AFK-Math
**I made this with 0 python knowlage (litteraly) so the code is dogshit, but it works (*most of the time*)**

This is what happens when you get 6 hours in jail and go to sleep with this script on (Kicked me when 10 minutes of jail was left lmao)

Works best in night sky, dark areas, jail walls. Should work with streched resolutions.
- If you want it to work all the time while looking at the sky I suggest you get a black sky mod.
- If you mine oil and don't want to get any mods get a black mule/truck/journey and make it so your chat is aimed at the black color.

**Wont be working on this anymore btw.**

# How to use
1. Download: "ECRP_AfkMath.py"
2. Download: [Tesseract-OCR](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.0.1.20220107.exe)
- Install it in given default location. (If you don't install it in: (C or D):\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe then change its location in ECRP_AfkMath.py)
3. pip install the requirements:
